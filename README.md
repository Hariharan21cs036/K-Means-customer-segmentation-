<h2>ABOUT</h2>

**What is  K-Means Clustering Algorithm ?**
K-Means is a popular clustering algorithm used in machine learning and data analysis. 
It is an unsupervised learning technique that groups data points into clusters based on their similarity. 


**Importance of K-Means Clustering Algorithm **

1. K-Means helps in exploring and understanding the underlying structure within a dataset.
2. K-Means can be used in image compression by clustering similar pixel values together.
3. K-Means can be part of recommendation systems to cluster users or items based on their behavior or features. 
4. K-Means can be used for data reduction, which is valuable in scenarios where storage or transmission of data is costly or limited.

<h2>TECHNOLOGIES USED</h2>

The [Intel® OneAPI toolkit](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/tools/oneapi/toolkits.html#gs.3btkxe), [Intel® K-Mean Clustering algorithm](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/docs/programmable/683395/current/k-mean-clustering-algorithm.html) The goal of K-Means clustering is to partition a dataset into K distinct, non-overlapping clusters, where each data point belongs to the cluster with the nearest mean.
