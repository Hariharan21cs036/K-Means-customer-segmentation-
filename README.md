The Customer segmentation is a part of K-Means Clustering Algorithm.The K-Means Algorithm is an Unsupervised Learning algorithm.
<h2>ABOUT</h2>

**What is  K-Means Clustering Algorithm ?**
K-Means is a popular clustering algorithm used in machine learning and data analysis. 
It is an unsupervised learning technique that groups data points into clusters based on their similarity. 


**Importance of K-Means Clustering Algorithm **

1. K-Means helps in exploring and understanding the underlying structure within a dataset.
2. K-Means can be used in image compression by clustering similar pixel values together.
3. K-Means can be part of recommendation systems to cluster users or items based on their behavior or features. 
4. K-Means can be used for data reduction, which is valuable in scenarios where storage or transmission of data is costly or limited.

<h2>TECHNOLOGIES USED</h2>
<p align="center">
  <img src="https://github.com/kamesh0407/stock_market_prediction/blob/main/InteloneAPI.jpg" width="400" height="240" >
</p>

The [Intel® OneAPI toolkit](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/tools/oneapi/toolkits.html#gs.3btkxe), [Intel® OpenVINO toolkit](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/tools/openvino-toolkit/overview.html) enables models to be trained in a more efficient way and results in faster training times. ADAM optimization algorithm is used and a MSE loss function is optimized.





<h2>METHODOLOGY</h2>
<li>The model was trained using Google's stock market data(Date, Open, High, Low, Close, Volume) to enhance its technical proficiency.
</li>
<li>  The keras model helps to create a model, layer by layer. The dense layer is fully connected layer, so all the neurons in a layer are connected to those in a next layer by using tensorflow as a backend.</li>

**LONG SHORT TERM MEMORY NETWORK:**
 LTSMs are a type of Recurrent Neural Network for learning long-term dependencies.
It is commonly used for processing and predicting time-series data.

<h2>PLATFORMS</h2>


**CODES IN DIFFERENT PLATFORMS:**

It tooks nearly 48seconds to 58 seconds to run single keras model files in Jupyter n0tebook
But in OPENVINO it took 135 milliseconds to 141 milliseconds to run it where this keras model consist of 100 files to run it and make to fit for the model.
